Creating a Dirty Martini in the style of a 1940's fancy hotel restaurant would involve a blend of sophistication and simplicity. Here's how you might craft it:

### Dirty Martini Recipe (1940's Style)

#### Ingredients:
- 2 oz of high-quality gin (the preference of the era)
- 1/2 oz dry vermouth
- 1/4 to 1/2 oz olive brine (adjust to how "dirty" you prefer)
- Ice
- Olives for garnish

#### Preparation:
1. **Chill the Martini Glass**: Begin by chilling your martini glass. This can be done by filling it with ice water and setting it aside while you prepare the drink.

2. **Mix the Ingredients**: In a mixing glass, combine the gin, dry vermouth, and olive brine. The amount of brine can be adjusted based on how "dirty" you like your martini.

3. **Stir, Don't Shake**: Contrary to popular James Bond lore, a classic martini is stirred, not shaken. Stir the mixture gently with a long-handled bar spoon for about 30 seconds. This blends the flavors without overly diluting the drink.

4. **Discard the Ice from the Martini Glass**: Your glass should now be nicely chilled. Discard the ice water.

5. **Strain and Serve**: Using a strainer, pour the stirred mixture into the chilled martini glass.

6. **Garnish**: Add one or two olives on a cocktail stick for garnish. In the 1940s, garnishes were often simple and elegant.

7. **Presentation**: Serve immediately, presenting the drink with a nod to the sophistication of the era.

Remember, the key to a great Dirty Martini lies in the quality of the gin and the balance of flavors. The 1940s were a time of elegance and simplicity, and this drink reflects that ethos.
