Author: Heather Christo
Prep time:  10 mins Cook time:  3 mins Total time:  13 mins
Serves: 4
 
Ingredients
1 cup fresh lightly packed mint leaves
2 limes, sliced in wedges
8 ounces white rum
Blood Orange Soda (San Pellegrino makes a great one)
1 cup unsweetened pure cranberry juice
ice cubes
mint leaves, lime wedges and fresh blueberries for garnish
Ginger Simple Syrup,
1 knob of peeled raw ginger, about 2” long
½ cup water
½ cup sugar
sugar rim:
lime wedge
brown sugar
Garnish: fresh mint, cranberries and slivers of candied ginger
Instructions
For the Ginger simple syrup:
In a small pan, combine the ginger, sugar and water and bring to a simmer, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes. Then set aside to chill. You can make this ahead of time.
For the Sugar rim:
Rub the rims of the glasses with a lime wedge and then gently coat them in brown sugar. Let them dry as you get together the ingredients for the drinks.
To make the Mojitos:
In the bottom of four heavy highball glasses, divide the mint and lime wedges evenly between the four glasses, 2 tablespoons simple syrup to each glass and use a muddler to smash them all together and release the mint oil and lime juice.
Add ice cubes, rum and blood orange soda to fill the glass most of the way. Put a floater of cranberry juice on the top (a couple tablespoons) You could serve as is (I love the look of the floater and the two different colors) or stir them together.
Garnish with fresh mint, cranberries and candied ginger
