Makes 1 drink

Ice
2 ounces rye or bourbon whiskey
1/2 ounce sweet vermouth, usually red
1/2 ounce dry vermouth, usually white
2 dashes angostura, peychauds or orange bitters
Maraschino cherry (traditional) or small piece lemon peel for garnish

Add rye, vermouths and bitters to a cocktail shaker with ice and stir (if you want to be uber-traditional about it) or shake them together. Strain ice as you pour into a rocks or martini glass, or pour ice and drink into a tumbler. Garnish and enjoy slowly because this is bonkers potent
