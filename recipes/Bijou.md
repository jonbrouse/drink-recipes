## Bijou

Bijou means ‘jewel’ in french.  The original recipe calls for equal parts, which is pretty intense. Then Dale Degroff in the 90s updated it to 1.5/0.75/0.75.

1. Combine the following in mixing glass with ice:
	- 2 oz Barr Hill Gin (Order a bottle online or find a store near you)
	- ½ oz Sweet Vermouth
	- ½ oz Green Chartreuse
	- 2 dashes Orange Bitters
2. Stir and strain into a cocktail glass (or over ice)
3. Garnish with an orange twist
