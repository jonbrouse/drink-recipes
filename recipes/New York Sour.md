## New York Sour

1. Combine in shaker
	- Ice
	- ½ cup (4 oz) rye whiskey or bourbon
	- ¼ cup (2 oz) freshly squeezed lemon juice
	- 2 tablespoons (1 oz) simple syrup, plus more to taste
	- 1 large egg white (optional)
	- 2 to 3 tablespoons red wine
2. Strain over more ice into two glasses.
3. Place a thin spoon upside-down at the surface of the drink and slowly, in the barest trickle, pour 1 to 1 ½ tablespoons of red wine over the back of it, moving it across the drink’s surface as you pour. If all goes well, the wine will stay at the surface of the drink.

Note: To make simple syrup, combine 4 tablespoons granulated sugar with 2 tablespoons water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer, stirring just until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat, add 2 tablespoons of cold water (to speed up the cooling process) and pour into a jar or bowl to finish cooling. You’ll have a little more than you need here, but it keeps forever in the fridge.
