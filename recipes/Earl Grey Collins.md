# Earl Grey Collins

1. Add the following to a shaker and shake:
	- ⅔ oz (50ml) gin
	- 1¼ oz (35ml) elderflower cordial
	- 1 oz (25ml) lemon juice
2. Strain into collins glass with fresh ice 
3. Top with 2½ oz (75ml) club soda
4. Drop in 1 earl grey tea bag, stir it around the glass five times, so you can see the tea infusing with the liquids, then serve.

The infusion will evolve and deepen as you drink, releasing more tea and more flavour over time.
