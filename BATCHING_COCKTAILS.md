# Batching Cocktails

1. Replace substitute "cups" for ounces. 
2. Instead of shaking or stirring on ice, dilute the drink by adding 20 percent water. 

Hold off on batching citrus drinks until right before quests arrive. Prepare spirits ahead of time and squeeze your citrus right before guests arrive.
