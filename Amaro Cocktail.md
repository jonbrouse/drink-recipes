# Amaro Cocktail

For the orgeat:
2 cups raw pecans
2 tsp black peppercorns
1.5 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp whole allspice
2 cups sugar
For the cocktail:
1.5 oz Amaro Montenegro
0.5 oz Rittenhouse Rye
0.75 oz fresh lemon juice
0.75 oz homemade orgeat
1 large egg white
Pecan half (for garnish)
Preparation
Orgeat:
Toast pecans, peppercorns, coriander seeds, and allspice in a small saucepan over medium heat until slightly darkened in color and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add sugar and 1⅓ cups water and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Let cool and strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring glass; discard solids.
Cocktail:
Combine amaro, rye, lemon juice, and ¾ oz. orgeat in a shaker filled with ice. Shake until outside of shaker is frosty, about 30 seconds. Double-strain into a glass, then return to shaker. Add egg white, cover, and shake again until frothy, about 1 minute. Pour into a chilled coupe glass and top with a pecan.
