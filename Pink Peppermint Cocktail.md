# Pink Peppermint Cocktail 

1. Prepare the candy cane vodka 30 minutes before.
2. Rim a glass with a drop of water and dip it in either sparkling sugar or crushed candy canes. 
3. Fill cocktail shaker with the following ingredients and shake:
    - 2 ounces candy cane vodka
    - 2 ounce creme de cacao (white)
    - 1 ounce vanilla simple syrup
    - 1/2 ounce cream or half and half
4. Pour in the glass and garnish with a candy cane.

## Peppermint Vodka

- 12 full-sized candy canes
- 1  750 ml  bottle vodka

1. Using a food processor or coffee grinder, pulse 12 full sized candy canes to fine powder. 
2. Using funnel or a sheet of parchment paper, pour candy cane powder into jar of vodka. 
3. Screw on lid and shake to mix. 
4. Let vodka sit, shaking occasionally, until candy dissolves and vodka turns red, about 30 minutes.  
5. If they’re are bits of candy cane remaining, strain with a fine mesh strainer and return to the jar.  

Keep vodka sealed & refrigerated. Should last up to a month.

## Vanilla Bean Syrup

- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup water
- 1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped
- 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Combine the sugar, water, scraped vanilla beans, whole bean and extract in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is bubbling. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Let cool completely before storing in a jar. I usually don’t remove the vanilla pod and just leave it in for flavor. You can remove it if you wish!
