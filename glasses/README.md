## Spirit Glasses

• Shot Glass — It’s found in most bars across the U.S. and holds one-and-a-half fluid ounces.
• Shooter — Perfect for layered shots like the B-52, brain hemorrhage, kamikaze, and lemon drop, the shooter is typically about a double portion of a shot glass.
• Cordial — Ideal for after-dinner liqueurs and small cocktails, a cordial is a stemmed glass that’s usually between one and one and a half ounces.
• Snifter — The snifter, balloon, or brandy bowl is a wide-rimmed, stout glass that’s among the best drinking glasses for brandies, cognacs, and after-dinner drinks. It’s also become popular for drinking IPAs. If you’re trying to reduce the number of types of glasses in your cabinet, having a few of these glasses on hand is probably a good idea.
• Single Rocks — Often, bartenders will pour out a single on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass, but technically, the old-fashioned is for a double portion, and some bars have separate glasses for singles.
• NEAT Glass — A recently designed invention, this strangely shaped glass is meant to choke out the “nose-numbing ethanol” and reveal the more complex aromas of plain spirits like whiskey and bourbons.
• Wobble Glass — A fun and fashionable new style of unique drinking glasses, the wobbling glasses are “un-spillable” and feature a convex bottom that rolls the alcohol around inside.
• Absinthe Glass — A once-obscure drink that resurfaced in popularity after re-legalization, absinthe has its own glass and typically comes with a slotted spoon, among other accouterments.
• Grappa Glass — For wines made from leftover skins, pulps, and seeds, this glass is meant to trap the beverage and create a long “aroma chimney.”
• Glencairn Whisky Glass — A relatively new invention, this Scottish-made glass developed by Glencairn Crystal Ltd. is specifically designed for sipping Scotch whiskey.
• Ochoko — Sake is traditionally poured out of a flask called a tokkuri into small cups, which are either ochoko (the common type of cups Westerners see), sakazuki (which are like saucers), or masu (which are wooden boxes).


## Cocktail Glasses

• Lowball Glass — Among the most universal cocktail glass types, the lowball or old-fashioned glass is perfect for muddled drinks. Often, people just use them for drinking spirits on the rocks.
• Highball Glass — Taller than the lowball, this is another one of of the more common types of drinking glasses that bartenders reach for.
• Collins Glass — A 12-to-14-ounce glass that’s taller and slimmer than a highball, the Collins glass, once used primarily for the Tom Collins, can be used for a large number of cocktails. It looks very good sporting some manner of long garnish.
• Martini — A classic piece of cocktail glassware, there’s nothing quite like the unique shape of the martini glass, which was popularized by James Bond and is now used for many types of cold, [shaken drinks](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/drinks/g9158516/fun-martini-recipes-vodka-gin/).
• Cosmopolitan — This drink, a frequent star of Sex and the City and integral to the Manhattan identity, can certainly go in a martini glass but really belongs in the short, squat version.
• Coupe — In recent years, the martini glass has been replaced by the more retro-chic coupe, a leftover from the Prohibition era. It’s the perfect vessel for many kinds of cold, shaken cocktails as well as bubbly wines. It’s far less tippy, more aesthetically pleasing, and fantastically versatile.
• Fizzio — The obscure, Prohibition-era “fizzio coupe” is a flat-bottomed glass typically used with bubbly wines and cocktails. It’s perfect for those hoping to emulate the look and feel of The Great Gatsby.
• Nick and Nora — This is another Prohibition-era glass that’s skyrocketed in popularity in recent years. Like the coupe, it’s usually used for brandies, cocktails, and bubbly drinks. It only holds about five ounces, though.
• Zombie — This classic glass once exclusively for the traditional zombie drink recipe is today a popular container for dozens of popular cocktails.
• Sour — Almost like a short champagne flute, the sour glass is ideal for whiskey sours and amaretto sours.
• Sling — This tall glass meant to hold ice and reduce condensation is great for a Long Island iced tea.
• Punch Cup — Punch has a long history, dating back to Dickensian times. One doesn’t often find it at bars, but it still sometimes appears at holiday parties.
• Margarita — With a wide rim often covered in salt, this strangely shaped glass is a favorite for the famous margarita, both frozen and fresh.
• Hurricane Glass — This is a favorite for hurricane cocktails, which feature rum and several types of juice.
• Irish Coffee Mug — Hot cocktails like the classic hot toddy and Irish coffee are usually put into this mug, which has a handle so you don’t burn your fingers.
• Moscow Mule Mug — In recent years, the Moscow mule and Kentucky mule have exploded in popularity. The copper of these cups is supposed to enhance the unique flavors of the drinks.
• Julep Cup — The mint julep has a [long and proud history](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/05/the-history-of-the-mint-julep/361659/) and is typically downed from a pewter or sterling silver cup.
• Tiki Glass — After World War II, Polynesian-style drinks spiked in popularity, and they’ve experienced a recent renaissance.
• Fountain Glass — This glass is perfect for a variety of boozy ice cream floats.
